# Spoonflower Fabric Search

Author: Amanda Hennel
Description: A simple React application that displays Spoonflower fabric products and allows users to narrow their search by certain criteria.

I plan to continue this project for educational purposes after initial delivery. TODO list:

- Add Typescript
- Write unit tests using Jest
- Add Product filter to display other prouct types
- Add UI framework like Material or similar
- Add more accessibility features
- Lazy load images
- Split out all styles into seprate files for each componeent
- Look into cookie cross-site request, most likely to use express.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
